            <p>Winning is not everything.....but making effort to win is<br>Everyone has a favorite sport; my favorite sport is football. I love the game of football, it is a fun game to watch and play. The game is also a physical game to play; I love to be physical. That’s probably why I like it; also, football brings people together. There’s nothing better than getting together on thanksgiving to watch football. I like every sport, but football is my favorite because of the love I have for the game, the physicality of the game, and the way the game brings people together.</p>
